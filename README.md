![CI Build](https://github.com/fabric8-analytics/fabric8-analytics-vscode-extension/workflows/Tests/badge.svg?branch=master)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/fabric8-analytics/fabric8-analytics-vscode-extension/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=rHIO4KNlJ0)](https://codecov.io/gh/fabric8-analytics/fabric8-analytics-vscode-extension)

Dependency Analytics is powered by [Snyk Intel Vulnerability DB](https://snyk.io/product/vulnerability-database/). It is the most advanced and accurate open source vulnerability database in the industry and adds value with the latest, fastest, and numerous vulnerabilities derived from multiple sources.

'Dependency Analytics Report' with Insights about your application dependencies:

- Flags a security vulnerability(CVE) and suggests a remedial version
- Shows Github popularity metrics along with the latest version
- Suggests a project level license, check for conflicts between dependency licenses
- AI-based guidance for additional, alternative dependencies

> **Disclaimer**: Dependency Analytics does not analyse **dev/test** dependencies.

## Supported Languages

'Dependency Analytics' extension supports projects using Maven, npm (Node ecosystem), Python, and Golang.
Extending support for other languages is currently in progress.

## Prerequisites

This extension assumes you have the following binaries on your `PATH`:

- `mvn` (for analyzing Java applications)
- `npm` (for analyzing Node applications)
- `python` (for analyzing Python applications)
- `go` (for analyzing Golang applications)

**Note:** By default, the `mvn/npm/go` command is executed directly in the terminal, which requires that `mvn/npm/go` is found in your system environment `PATH`. For Python applications [Interpreter Path](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_manually-specify-an-interpreter) is required to be provided as below.
You can do this via preferences in VS Code:
File(Code on macOS) > Preferences > Settings to open your [Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) select Workspace (open settings.json) and add below.

```
{
    ...
    "maven.executable.path": "/path-to-maven-home/bin/mvn"
    "npm.executable.path": "/path-to-npm-home/bin/npm"
    "python.pythonPath": "/path-to-python-home/bin/python"
    "go.executable.path": "/path-to-go/bin/go"
    ...
}
```

> **NOTE** Dependency Analytics is an online service hosted and maintained by Red Hat. This open source software will access only your manifests and license file(s) to learn about application dependencies and licenses before giving you the report.

## Quick Start

- Install the extension.
- Opening or editing a manifest file (`pom.xml` / `package.json` / `requirements.txt` / `go.mod`) scans your application for security vulnerabilities.
- Right click on a manifest file (`pom.xml`/`package.json` / `requirements.txt` / `go.mod`) in the 'Vscode File explorer' or 'Vscode File editor' to display 'Dependency Analytics Report' for your application.

## Features

1. Opening or editing a manifest file (`pom.xml` / `package.json` / `requirements.txt` / `go.mod`) scans your application for security vulnerabilities, flag them along with 'Quick Fix'.

3. Right-click on a manifest file(`pom.xml` / `package.json` / `requirements.txt`) and choose 'Dependency Analytics Report ...' OR click on ![icon](images/0.2.0/icon.png) icon in editor group OR click on status bar message to display 'Dependency Analytics' report as shown below. This report covers deeper insights into your application dependencies:

- Flags a security vulnerability(CVE) and suggests a remedial version
- Shows Github popularity metrics along with the latest version
- Suggests a project level license, check for conflicts between dependency licenses
- AI-based guidance for additional, alternative dependencies

## Ignoring Vulnerabilities during analysis

If users wish to ignore vulnerabilities for a dependency, it can be done by adding "crdaignore" as a comment in the manifest file for Python, Maven, Golang. Node manifest files don't support comments; hence "crdaignore" must be given inside a JSON.
If "crdaignore" is followed by a list of comma-separated Snyk vulnerability IDs, only listed vulnerabilities ignored during analysis, in case "crdaignore" is not followed by any list, all vulnerabilities present in a package will be ignored.

# Examples

# Python
Ignore all vulnerabilities in fastapi and few for flask

```
fastapi==0.36.0 #crdaignore
sceptre==2.2.1
flask==1.0 #crdaignore [<Snyk vulnerability ID 1 >, <Snyk vulnerability ID 2 >]
```
# Golang
Ignore all the security vulnerabilities present in the "ginkgo" and "pax-go" dependencies in a golang manifest file.
```
	code.cloudfoundry.org/archiver v0.0.0-20170223024658-7291196139d7
	github.com/googleapis/gax-go v1.0.3 //crdaignore [<Snyk vulnerability ID 1 >]
	github.com/googleapis/gax-go/v2 v2.0.5
	github.com/onsi/ginkgo v1.14.2 // indirect crdaignore 
	github.com/onsi/gomega v1.10.3 // indirect 

```
# Maven
Ignore all vulnerabilities of the dependency "junit:junit". 

```
 <dependency>
      <groupId>junit</groupId>  <!--crdaignore-->
      <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
      <version>3.8.1</version>
 </dependency>
```
Note: To ignore vulnerabilities for a dependency in a maven manifest file, insert "crdaignore" in comments against the group id, artifact id, or version of that particular dependency.

# Node
Ignore all the security vulnerabilities for "bootstrap" and a set of vulnerabilities for the "lodash" package.
```
"crdaignore": {
			"packages": {
				"bootstrap": [
					"*"
				],
				"lodash": [<Snyk vulnerability ID 1 >]
			}
	},
```
A sample npm manifest file with the security vulnerabilities to ignore during analysis:
```
{
		"name": "node-js-sample",
		"version": "0.2.0",
		"description": "A sample Node.js app using Express 4",
		"main": "index.js",
		"scripts": {
				"start": "node index.js"
		},
		"dependencies": {
				"ansi-styles": "3.2.1",
				"escape-string-regexp": "1.0.5",

				"bootstrap": "4.1.1",
				"libnmap": "0.4.15",
				"lodash": "4.17.11",
				"html-purify": "1.1.0"
		},
		"engines": {
				"node": "4.0.0"
		},
		"crdaignore": {
			"packages": {
				"bootstrap": [
					"*"
				],
				"lodash": ["vulnerability 1"]
			}
		},
		"repository": {
				"type": "git",
				"url": "https://github.com/heroku/node-js-sample"

# Common Errors and FAQ

1. VScode output says "Go executable not found".

    **Suggestion:** Try adding your go executable path to your vscode's settings.json file

    **E.g.:** `"go.executable.path": "/path-to-go/bin/go"`

2. Failed to run golist command.

    **Suggestion:** Resolve the error thrown by `go mod tidy` and `go list` for the project and try again. 

3. Stack analysis fails after applying the recommended version.

    **Suggestion:** Not all recommended versions work directly, developers need to resolve dependencies for the recommended version using `go mod tidy` or manually.

4. Plugin does not highlight vulnerabilities in vendor code.

    **Suggestion:** Currently plugin does not support vendor (or local) code vulnerabilities scanning. Switch to go.mod to express your project dependencies.
